# Tiny-Lang-Compiler

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a compiler implemented in C# for a programming language called Tiny Language. The project was developed as part of the
Compiler Theory course. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the understanding and application of compiler construction principles, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic
analysis.

## Features
* Lexical Analysis: Tokenizes the input source code into a stream of tokens.
* Syntax Parsing: Parses the token stream to create a parse tree.
